'''
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, 
with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:

        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        i, l, r = 0, 0, len(nums)-1
        
        while i <= r:
            if nums[i] == 0:
                nums[i], nums[l] = nums[l], nums[i]
                l += 1
            elif nums[i] == 2:
                nums[i], nums[r] = nums[r], nums[i]
                r -= 1
                i -= 1
            i += 1
